Term Deposit Propensity Prediction

In this project, I worked on a dataset provided from an imaginary company called ACME, which is assumed as a small startup focusing mainly on providing machine learning solutions in the European banking market.

Main goal is to set up an end to end ML project to predict customers Term Deposit buying propensity by using call center data. In other words, its been tried to put a probability about whether customers willing to subscribe term deposit. Addition to this, last part was reserved to clustering of customers to find out the customers who are more likely to buy investment products.

The dataset is provided by an employer directly with the following [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EW-XMnGfxn-qzGtGPa3v_C63Yqj2aGf7), which includes 40 thousand of customer data with 14 features including term deposit ownership.

The first part of this report is devoted to data exploration, and continues with the parts of data transformation and model establishment, respectively. At the last part, final model is decided and a function was defined to use pre trained ML model to predict by using raw data whether a customer is willing to subscribe Term Deposit or not.
